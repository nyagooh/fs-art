Masterpiece Generator
Welcome to the ASCII Art Masterpiece Generator! This program takes text input and transforms it into stunning ASCII art using a series of intricate functions. Let's dive into the magical world of ASCII characters and unleash your creativity like never before.

### Unleash Your Creativity ‚ú®
With the ASCII Art program, you can turn a simple text into a mesmerizing graphic masterpiece. Watch as your text comes to life in a stunning display of ASCII art, making your program truly stand out.

### Let's Play with Text üé®
Imagine typing "Hello" and witnessing the transformation as ASCII characters dance across your screen, creating a visual symphony of letters and symbols. It's not just text anymore; it's art in motion!

### Experience the ASCII Art Show üé≠
Run the program with a your desired text, sit back, and behold the ASCII art extravaganza unfold before your eyes. Each character takes on a new form, weaving a story of creativity and imagination in the digital realm.

# <span style="color:lightgreen">How it Works</span> 
- The program takes a string input from the command line.

- It checks if the input string contains any unprintable characters (outside the ASCII range 32-126). If it does, it prints an error message and exits.

- It then checks if the input string contains any tabs (\t). If it does, it replaces them with four spaces ( ).
- It then checks if the input string contains any newlines (\n). If it does,The program splits the input string into individual lines using the newline character (\n).
- For each line, it applies a set of predefined functions to convert each character to its corresponding ASCII art representation. The functions are:
    - FindHeadLine: maps characters to a specific ASCII art representation based on their position in the ASCII table.
    - Line2, Line3, Line4, Line5, Line6, Line7, and Line8: each maps characters to a specific ASCII art representation based on their position in the ASCII table.
- The program then concatenates the resulting ASCII art representations for each line to form the final output.

## <span style="color:deeppink">Installation</span>
