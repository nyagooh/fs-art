Here is a masterpiece generator that takes text input and transforms it into stunning ASCII using the specific bannar file passed.
With the FS program which is built on ASCII ART program, you can turn a simple text into a mesmerizing graphic masterpiece by specifying the banner file to be used. 
 ## <span style="color:#80A4ED">Files featured</span>
The program works with 3 potent files:
 1. standard.txt
 2. shadow.txt
 3. thinkertoy.txt
 
 The default file used is standard textual file.

## <span style="color:#80A4ED">How it Works</span> 
- The program takes a string input and the banner filefrom the command line.
```bash
go run . hello standard
```
- It checks if the input string contains any unprintable characters (outside the ASCII range 32-126). If it does, it prints an error message and exits.eg.
```bash
go run . ä½ å¥½
The program will exit in this casee
```
- It checks if the banner file is valid.If not it prints an error e.g
``` bash
go run . hello stan
no such file or directory
```
- It then checks if the input string contains any tabs (\t). If it does, it replaces them with four spaces ( ) eg.
```bash
go run . hello\tworld
 _                                         
| |                                        
| |__                           __      __ 
|  _ \                          \ \ /\ / / 
| | | |                          \ V  V /  
|_| |_|                           \_/\_/   
```
- It then checks if the input string contains any newlines (\n). If it does,The program splits the input string into individual lines using the newline character (\n). eg.
```bash
go run . h\\nw
_      
| |     
| |__   
|  _ \  
| | | | 
|_| |_| 
        
        
           
           
__      __ 
\ \ /\ / / 
 \ V  V /  
  \_/\_/   
           
           
```
- For each line, it applies a set of predefined functions to convert each character to its corresponding ASCII art representation. 
- The program then concatenates the resulting ASCII art representations for each line to form the final output.

To install the program from Gitea, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository from Gitea using the provided URL in your terminal.

```

and run the program using ***go run  .*** ,input your text  and the banner file you want to use.eg
```
go run . Helloworld standard
```
The program will output :
``` bash
 _    _          _   _                                     _       _

| |__| |   ___  | | | |   ___   __      __   ___    _ __  | |   __| | 
|  __  |  / _ \ | | | |  / _ \  \ \ /\ / /  / _ \  | '__| | |  / _` | 
| |  | | |  __/ | | | | | (_) |  \ V  V /  | (_) | | |    | | | (_| | 
|_|  |_|  \___| |_| |_|  \___/    \_/\_/    \___/  |_|    |_|  \__,_| 
                                                                      
                                                                      
```
